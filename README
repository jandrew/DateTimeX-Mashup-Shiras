Abstract here!

Build from Source - (for example git)
	
	Download a compressed file with the code
	
	Extract the code from the compressed file

	Change into the extracted directory

	(For Windows find what version of make was used to compile your perl)
  		perl  -V:make

	Then

	>perl Makefile.PL

	>make

	>make test

	>make install

	>make clean
	(use the windows make version as appropriate (nmake?))dir

Build from cpanp - TODO

Install with Dist::Zilla - This only works with the CPAN download (not the github .tar.gz file)
$ dzil install Package-Name-.tar.gz
