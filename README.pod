L<Shiras|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose#Subspecies> - A small subspecies of 
Moose found in the western United States.

This is a Moose Role that provides combined functionality from three different 
L<DateTime::Format> packages. The three modules are; 
L<DateTime::Format::DateManip>, L<DateTime::Format::Epoch>, and 
L<DateTime::Format::Excel>.  It then uses the Moose type coersion system to choose 
the correct way to format the date.  This means that all input strings are 
parsed by ::DateManip.  All numbers are parsed either by ::Format::Excel or 
::Format::Epoch.  Since the numbers of each overlap, the general rule is all 
positive numbers under 7 positions left of the decimal are given to ::Excel and 
negative integers and integers of 7 or greater positions are given to ::Epoch.  
Numbers outside of this range fail the type constraints.  I<See the 'Attribute' 
section below for a way to force the numerical values to be parsed by the 
non-preffered formatter in the overlap.> Currently the Epoch is fixed at midnight 
1-January-1970.  Since all the date 'getters' return DateTime objects, all the 
L<DateTime> formats can be applied directly.  ex. $inst->get_today_wkend->ymd( "/" ).  

I learned the magic for the input coersion from 
L<The Moose is Flying (part 2)|http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col95.html> 
by Merlyn / Randal L. Schwartz++.  Any goodness found here should be attributed there, 
while I accept the responsibility for any errors.

Build from Source - (for example git)
	
	Download a compressed file with the code
	
	Extract the code from the compressed file

	Change into the extracted directory

	(For Windows find what version of make was used to compile your perl)
  		perl  -V:make

	Then

	>perl Makefile.PL

	>make

	>make test

	>make install

	>make clean
	(use the windows make version as appropriate (nmake?))dir
